= Creating a Release

Each time a Konflux component is built, an Application Snapshot is automatically generated to be processed. When this occurs, another Konflux service generates a Release resource for each ReleasePlan associated with that application within the workspace. Alternatively, users can initiate a manual release by linking the Snapshot and ReleasePlan themselves, triggering the release pipeline to complete the release of their application.

Hereâ€™s an example of a Release resource in action.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: Release
metadata:
  name: <name-of-this-release> <.>
  namespace: dev-workspace <.>
spec:
  data: <key> <.>
  releasePlan: <release-plan-name> <.>
  snapshot: <application-snapshot-name> <.>
----

<.> The name of the release.
<.> The development team's workspace.
<.> Optional: An unstructured key used for providing data for the managed Pipeline.
<.> The name of the release plan specifying the pipeline to run.
<.> The name of the application snapshot that you want to release.
